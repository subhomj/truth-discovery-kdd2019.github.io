# Overview
In recent times, the explosion of information from a variety of sources has made it increasingly important to check the credibility and reliability of the underlying data. Large volumes of data generated from diverse information channels like social media, online news outlets, and crowd-sourcing contribute valuable knowledge; however, this comes with additional challenges to ascertain the credibility of user-generated information, resolving conflicts among heterogeneous data sources, identifying misinformation, etc. Given diverse information about an object (e.g., a natural language claim text, an entity, and an SPO like triple) from heterogeneous and multi-modal sources, how do we identify high quality and trustworthy information and information sources? How can we leverage Knowledge Bases and external evidence sources from the web for reasoning, explaining and validating claims? How can we generate human-interpretable explanations for the models' verdict.

In order to answer these questions, this workshop encourages submissions to focus on big ideas for resolving conflicts, fact-checking and ascertaining credibility of claims in heterogeneous and multi-modal sources of information --- focusing both on unstructured texts, natural language claims, relational data and knowledge graphs.
  
# Call For Papers
	
Large volumes of data generated from diverse information channels, such as social media, online news outlets and crowd-sourcing, contribute valuable knowledge but also bring challenges to ascertain the credibility of user-generated information, resolving conflicts between various data sources, identifying  misinformation from text etc.  
	
Our workshop on truth discovery and fact-checking is motivated by the need for new research, tools and techniques to advance the field to handle the new challenges of multi-modal and heterogeneous modern data (for example, unstructured text and natural language claims); leveraging Knowledge Bases and external evidence sources for reasoning, validating and explaining contentious claims; and developing interpretable models that can generate human-interpretable explanations as opposed to black box methods.
	
The first workshop on _Truth Discovery and Fact Checking: Theory and practice_ will provide a forum where researchers and practitioners from academia, government and industry can share insights and identify new challenges and opportunities in resolving conflicts, fact-checking and ascertaining credibility of claims.

The workshop will be held in Anchorage, Alaska on August 4, 2019 in conjunction with the [https://www.kdd.org/kdd2019/](ACM SIGKDD 2019)


## Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:##
	
- Truth finding and discovery 
- Fact-checking, rumor and misinformation
- Credibility analysis
- Leveraging knowledge bases for reasoning, validating and explaining contentious claims
- Fake reviews and reviewers
- Transparency, fairness, bias, privacy and ethics of information systems
- Emerging applications for truth discovery and fact-checking
- Novel data sources and case studies
- Explainable and interpretable models
- Heterogeneous and multi-modal information including relational data, natural language text, search logs, images, video, etc. 
	
## Submission Guidelines ##

We invite submissions for original research papers both theory and application-oriented as well as submissions from the research track and applied data science track of the main conference. We also welcome case studies, extensions and applications of previously published research on the above topics of interest. We encourage the participants to submit papers on novel datasets and release them to advance the field. Papers must be submitted in PDF according to the ACM Proceedings Template (Tighter Alternate style). We welcome both long papers (maximum length of 9 pages) and short papers (maximum length of 5 pages). The accepted papers will be published on the workshop's website, and will not be considered archival for resubmission purposes. Submissions are handled through EasyChair.
